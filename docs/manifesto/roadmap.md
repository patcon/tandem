# Goals & Roadmap

Here are some of the major goals we have over the coming years and quarters.

## 2019

In 2019 we want to minimally realize our promise as agency-incubator.

This means we should end the year with a well-defined and documented agency operation, a product (Lando) that generates some revenue, and a plan for how we can grow that product so that it not only generates more revenue but also improves our agency.

### Q3 July - September

#### Agency Goal: Get the house in order

Before we start to grow and improve our agency operations we need to take a step back and take stock of the things we actually have. This means:

* ~~Documenting our current processes, procedures, and technical assets~~
* ~~Clarifying roles, responsibilities and expectations~~
* ~~Create a plan for orienting sales around service products~~

Concrete examples of the above are things like

* ~~Writing a guide for how to start a new project~~
* ~~A document that expresses the various phases of the project management life cycle~~
* ~~A spreadsheet that lists our start states~~
* Enumerating the responsibilities of each role at Tandem
* A project estimation spreadsheet
* An initial sales campaign for a service product

#### Product Goal: Monetize Lando

Before we invest more time into Lando we need it to start generating some revenue. Minimally it needs to generate enough to sustain _at least_ 10 hours a week of at -cost development. This breaks down into the more granular:

* ~~Get GitHub sponsorships and Patreon rolling for Lando Members~~
* ~~Switch to Carbon ads and monetize our YouTube page~~
* ~~Reboot our marketing efforts, leverage community as much as possible~~
* ~~Throw together a basic marketing site with some service offerings~~
* ~~Sign a few long term support deals~~
* ~~Move docs to [Vuepress](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/1410)~~

### Q4 October - December

::: tip PRO TIP
Previously we thought this would be the quarter to _GET RIGHT TO IT_ and start focusing on optimizing our agency operations with Lando-related things while also incubating new things but alas we jumped the gun and we've kicked that initiative to later next year.
:::

#### Agency Goal: Live our values

At this point this site should have an accurate-enough picture of our current agency, what it believes, why it exists, its goals. Now we need to start living those values outwardly so we can reboot the vision of Tandem 2.0 we put together in Q3.

For this quarter we need to focus on:

* Delivering what our clients want by doing our best work so they will recommend us _WITH ENTHUSIASM!!!_
* Rebooting our website so it reflects our values and our current reality better
* Rebooting our sales and marketing efforts in a similar way

Concrete examples of the above are things like

* Delivering FUCK YES! work for our clients that we are proud to talk about
* Launching a new <https://thinktandem.io>
* Getting sales and marketing tooling on autopilot

#### Product Goal: Release Lando and start to build out its revenue streams

At this point we have some _pending_ Lando related deals and sponsorships as well as a plan and the tools for launching other outreach and sales efforts with the goal of making Lando self-sustaining. We are going to continue to do that as we also finish up Lando so we can drop the stable release on January 1, 2020. Our sales and marketing related activities will also help greatly inform how we can reboot similar things for Tandem.

For this quarter we need to focus on:

* Fixing remaining major bugs
* Finishing implementing [name volume performance feature](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/1460)
* Finishing implementing [better SSH key handling](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/478)
* Launching Lando Alliance and related programs, services and campaigns

Concrete examples of the above are things like:

* Getting community members and evangelists into a more official contribution program
* Selling various Lando sponsorships and services
* Releasing the official Lando `3.0.0`
* Expanding our documenation and guides for long tail SEO purposes
* Increasing user base and ideally ways to get newsletter subscribers


## 2020

In 2020 we want to build out a reliable agency operation and continue to grow Lando users and revenue so we end the year with a solid foundation to move on the incubator part of our vision.

This means we should end the year with a core team that can handle basically _any_ project from sales all the way to launch and long term support. We should also create (and start to implement) a plan for how we can scale and become more efficient so as to start focusing more on our incubator ambitions.

### Q1 January - March

#### Agency Goal: Launch Tandem 2.0

At this point we should have enough tools, talent, portfolio and ethos to really start ramping up our agency marketing and sales operations. We need to get sales and marketing operations running as consistently and reliably as possible, ideally with automation so we end the quarter with a good pipeline and positive marketing growth.

For this quarter we need to focus on:

* Spreading the word and awesomeness of Tandem 2.0
* Developing a plan on how to scale when our sales efforts work
* Delivering even more value to our clients
* Doing a great job posting case studies and other marketing things

#### Product Goal: Grow Lando users and revenues

At this point we should have enough incoming passive revenue to pay for at least half a full time developer. We'd like to use that money to continue improving and supporting Lando with bug fixes and smaller features while also filling in billable gaps on the Agency side. We also would like to continue to market Lando, grow its user base while figuring out other ways to monetize it.

For this quarter we need to focus on:

* Rolling out new bug fix releases and a few smaller features
* Engaging with the Lando Alliance to increase exposure and users
* Piloting a few new monetization models
* Doing a great job posting case studies and other marketing things
* Consider next big feature

### Q1 April - September

::: tip PRO TIP
These are some tentative ideas
:::

#### Agency Goal: Grow our team!

* Full time designer?

#### Product Goal: New Features A

* Start to build out an awesome new killer feature

### Q3 July - September

::: warning PRO TIP
These were originally our Q4 2020 goals but are here as a placeholder for now because this might be a better time. To be revisited later.
:::

#### Agency Goal: Start to improve, automate and tie things together

At this point this site should paint an accurate-enough picture of our current agency, why it exists, its goals and more-or-less how it works towards them. Now we need to start refining that picture, giving frequent and repeatable tasks to the robots and figuring out how we can leverage our products, chiefly Lando, towards these designs. Specifically this means:

* Adding documentation for any key processes or procedures we don't have yet
* Improving and simplifying key documentation
* Replacing high-value or high-risk repeatable steps in our documentation with automation
* Getting more people using Lando to further these designs (see product goals below)
* Start expressing Tandem values in our explicit marketing and sales materials

Concrete examples of the above are things like

* Finally documenting that thing-you've-wanted-to-for-awhile
* Using `lando init` to automatically spin up new projects from start states
* Simplifying our "Start a new project" guide in light of the above automation
* Making our client qualification and project estimatation processes _even better_
* Running sales campaigns around service products derived from above automation

#### Product Goal: Release Lando and lock down its roadmap

At this point we should have enough incoming revenue to justify a final push towards a Lando stable release and the post-stable-release roadmap.

We've identified a _Lando Hub_ type offering as a subsequent product idea that we could proof of concept in our agency work. This would give us a single thing to work on that advances _in tandem_ both our agency goals of automation and value-over-hours and our desire to quickly bring another product to market. In order to do this we need to:

* Fix remaining major bugs
* Finish implementing [name volume performance feature](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/1460)
* Finish implementing [better SSH key handling](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/478)
* Define a _Lando Hub_ roadmap that also solves some of our immediate agency needs in its MVP
* Start working towards the above by slowly and strategically leveraging Lando to automate parts of our agency operation
