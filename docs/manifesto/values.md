# Values

**TODO:** We should attempt to link various parts of below to other docs eg "encourage professional development" should link to things like our tech/events stipend

NOTE: each of these sections would be broken into two parts: 1. high level overview of the value 2. specific things tandem does to make that happen

## Putting employees first

We've often heard that [_the customer/client is always right_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right) and while that is almost always true it's something that is hard to achieve if you don't [put employees first](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pavelkrapivin/2018/07/09/sir-richard-bransons-5-billion-reasons-to-make-your-employees-candidates-happy/#3b33e2ef6710). Putting employees first means they will also put clients and customers first and everyone wins.

At Tandem that specifically means that we invest in our employees by encouraging their professional development, arranging company retreats, providing equipment upgrades, conference stipends and fostering a culture where everyone can do meaningful work and have a good time doing it.

## Connecting the dots

Good companies thrive when they continually create mutually reinforcing positive feedback loops by tying things together and aligning incentives across the board.

* everyone can contribute to any project all the time
* good communication

## Building common purpose

It's important to be rowing the boat in the same direction but every now and then the boat requires a course correction.

* rowing the boat in the same direction but anyone can suggest a course correction (to anything, including itself)
* no idea is sacred, (irreverence), challenging dogma
* a clear and well defined process we all buy into
* clear roles and responsibility
* diversity of thought;

## Focusing on whats important

If you care about work/life balance, which we do, then it means time is an economy.

That means that we should always be striving to do the right thing, at the right and for the right reasons.

* distillation: breaking things down to their simplest parts
*  eg spend time and energy on things with longevity. example: dont spend a ton of time on documentation that is going to change, focus on documentation that is more “timeless”

## Treating people like adults

At Tandem we treat people like adults regardless of whether they are co-workers, client or customers.

This means that we will be transparent, honest and upfront with you but we won't be a dick about it.

* vigorous but respectful debate
* honesty; clients and coworkers
* respectful debate, discussion about ideas
* understanding each others passions and interests

## Maximizing flow

We strive to maximize our ability to be individually and collectively "in the zone".

This means

* autonomy, independence and freedom
* freedom to do your own thing, freedom from being micromanaged
* time to work on our own things, pro development
* efficiency, redundancy
* knowledge sharing
* maximizing flow (reducing distractions)
* good communication
* prioritizing (delivering the most value fastest)
* a clear and well defined process we all buy into
* Not forcing beliefs but building an environment we can all thrive in
* define a “keeper of the faith” role, someone to advocate for the “tandem way”
* predictability
* accuracy
* efficiency
* automation
* repeatable and consistent results
