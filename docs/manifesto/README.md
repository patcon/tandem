# Our mission

## Who are we?

We are a full-service, start-to-finish digital agency _and_ product incubator with a ton of experience and a long history of doing _awesome shit_. And, while we've done _a lot_ over that long history here are a few of the things we've done that we are most proud of

* Built _big_, _complex_ start-to-finish projects like [poets.org](https://thinktandem.io/work/poets-redesign/) and [the University of San Francisco](https://thinktandem.io/work/usf-d8-migration/)
* Provided high quality and super-fast support for companies like [GoHealth](https://www.gohealthuc.com/) and [CSI](https://www.csiamerica.com/)
* Created popular open source tools and products like [Lando](https://devwithlando.io/) and [Kalabox](https://www.kalabox.io/)
* Partnered with great companies like [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/docs/local-development/) and [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/blog/going-local-with-lando/)
* Trained premier orgs like [Aten](https://atendesigngroup.com/) and [Revolution Messaging](https://revolutionmessaging.com/)
* Helped organize community events like [DrupalCon](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/team) and [BadCamp](https://2018.badcamp.org/)
* Started and run other successful agencies like [Kalamuna](https://www.kalamuna.com/)

And through it all we've had a great time!!!

## Why do we exist?

> [So cool!](https://media1.tenor.com/images/731e2e6f4fa66bb743684245f8f6d25f/tenor.gif?itemid=11811009) but agency-incubators like [37Signals](https://37signals.com/) are not a super unique thing. What makes Tandem different?

Tandem exists as an agency because it believes clients deserve more than an agency doing more billable hours.

Tandem exists as a product incubator because it believes the best products come from a team doing things on its own terms and not from venture capital overlords.

As both, Tandem believes that client work inspires great product ideas and that clients get more value from great products.

To that end we strive to reach _the singularity_ where our client work and products become indistinguishable from one another.

## What do we do?

In order to collapse client work and products into _the singularity_ you need to be slowly turning repeatable parts of client work into _products_ that can be done consistently in a given amount of time. This allows you to bill for _value_ instead of _time_ which should _always_ deliver lower costs to the client and higher revenue per hour to the agency. This process should continually maximize revenue for the agency and by extension afford it additional time to _make more products_.

nd then

This is mostly possible

Fundamentally, we do it by [living our values]


* To build a company that can fund its own "startups" without the mind-forged-manacles of VC money, control our own destiny without losing whats imporant to us

HOW DO WE DO IT
As an agency we provide maximum value to clients per billable hour. As an incubator it takes the profits from its agency work and "angel funds" _company-agree-upon_ products. It does both _in tandem_. This means that

 fast, efficient and high quality agency services

uses agency consulting fees to "angel fund" _company-agree-upon_ product ideas and leverages

been-there-done-it team to incubate company-agree-upon products that both make the agency better but also can be offered as passive revenue generating stand-alone services.

* maximize fees by providing value
* using those fees to generate products that furthers maximization but also can be sold as stand alone SaaSy services.
* To deliver maximum value to clients and benefit from that, eg the better we do the more we both make more PER HOUR and get clients shit better, stronger, faster sooner,
* To build a positive feedback loop between the two things so that agency work gives us clear data about good product ideas and our good product ideas make our agency even better.
