# Our mission

## Who are we?

We are a full-service, start-to-finish digital agency _and_ product incubator with a ton of experience and a long history of doing _awesome shit_. And, while we've done _a lot_ over that long history here are a few of the things we've done that we are most proud of

* Built _big_, _complex_ start-to-finish projects like [poets.org](https://thinktandem.io/work/poets-redesign/) and [the University of San Francisco](https://thinktandem.io/work/usf-d8-migration/)
* Provided high quality and super-fast support for companies like [GoHealth](https://www.gohealthuc.com/) and [CSI](https://www.csiamerica.com/)
* Created popular open source tools and products like [Lando](https://devwithlando.io/) and [Kalabox](https://www.kalabox.io/)
* Partnered with great companies like [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/docs/local-development/) and [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/blog/going-local-with-lando/)
* Trained premier orgs like [Aten](https://atendesigngroup.com/) and [Revolution Messaging](https://revolutionmessaging.com/)
* Helped organize community events like [DrupalCon](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/team) and [BadCamp](https://2018.badcamp.org/)
* Started and run other successful agencies like [Kalamuna](https://www.kalamuna.com/)

And through it all we've had a great time!!!

## Why do we exist?

> [So cool!](https://media1.tenor.com/images/731e2e6f4fa66bb743684245f8f6d25f/tenor.gif?itemid=11811009) but agency-incubators like [37Signals](https://37signals.com/) are not a super unique thing. What makes Tandem different?

Tandem exists as an agency because it believes clients deserve better than an agency doing more billable hours.

Tandem exists as a product incubator because it believes the best products come from a team doing things on its own terms and not from venture capital overlords.

As both agency and incubator, Tandem believes that client work inspires great product ideas and that clients get more value from great products.

To that end we strive to reach [_the singularity_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgkDoSbHHVU) where our client work and products slowly move towards one another until they eventually combine, go supernova and thereafter become indistinguishable from one another.

## What do we do?

In order to collapse client work and products into _the singularity_ you need to be slowly removing repeatable parts of client work into turning them into _products_; things that can be done consistently in a given amount of time.

The more you do this the more you can increasingly bill clients for _value_, what they actually get, instead of _time_, how long it took them to get it. As _value_ grows as a larger percentage of the total bill the agency generates higher revenue per hour, and the client sees significantly reduces costs eg _everyone wins._

Higher agency revenue per hour means _more free time_. More free time means _more products_. More products means _higher agency revenue per hour_. Positive feedback loop established.

Of course this process only succeeds if we [do it right](./values.md).
