Tandem Internal Documentation
=============================

Goal
----

As a consultancy, our value is contained within our people and our process. Consistent excellence requires both of these elements working in harmony.

Documentation preserves our process. The goal of this documentation is to make it as easy as possible to find and store the essential knowledge of our processes. If a team member goes on vacation or decides to join the forest people, we should have documentation that allows us to hire an equally brilliant person and bring them "up-to-speed" on how Tandem operates as quickly as possible.

> We want to introduce people to the Tandem process as quickly as possible.

Who These Docs Are For
----------------------

1. New, existing, and prospective Tandem team members.
2. Current and potential clients interested in how we work.
3. Friends, foes, and future fellows to crib notes.

Why Are These Docs Public?
--------------------------

Nope, it isn't an accident. We think this information is very valuable. However, it's the combination of our team with these processes that makes Tandem's secret sauce.

We make this information public because we think open dialogue produces greater value than closed minds. If you share our opinion, feel free to [contact us](https://www.thinktandem.io/contact) and share your experience!
