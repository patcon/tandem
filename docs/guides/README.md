# Guides

Guides seek to answer _questions_ eg the who, what, where, why and hows that make Tandem go. They are operational materials geared towards accomplishing specific things or acquiring particular knowledge eg the _processes_ and _things_ of Tandem.

This is different from the Handbook which is geared around the _people_: employees, contractors and partners of Tandem.
