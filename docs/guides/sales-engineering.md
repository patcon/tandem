# Sales Engineering

Sales engineering at Tandem is primarily focused on providing _transparent_ and _accurate_ estimations for potential projects.

When estimating a project, your prime directive is to provide the sales team with tools to assess the risk and profitability of potential projects so that they can properly communicate these details to leads in a way that support Tandem's core values and mission. 

Sales engineering is *not* a tool to simply increase sales. The Quality of the work we produce, our profitability, and our happiness depends on identifying good opportunities where our team can excel and deliver exceptional value to clients.

Don't simply change estimates to match a predefined budget, if there is a conflict, scope needs to be sacrifced instead of accuracy. Work with the sales team and the client to suggest alternatives and reduce the scope of the project.

## The Project Estimate

The core deliverable from sales engineering is the project estimate. This
document clearly identifies the individual requirements we've deduced from all
information provided about the project to date along with an hour estimate that
has been vetted by multiple developers and the associated risk estimate.

### Prior art
As with so many things in our industry, there has been a lot of great work on this topic already, and we're borrowing heavily from our friends at Lullabot in designing this process. Their series of articles on estimation are a fantatstic resource.

The template for a new estimate is [available on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7PS1-01ScWN4MnRz2ahrBz3ZTNtTIMNuEpoMnH_NUo/edit#gid=16). Start by making a copy of this sheet named `CLIENT NAME - PROJECT NAME Estimate` and save it to the client folder on Google Drive.

Follow the directions on the worksheet and start by filling out the list of
requirements and any notes for estimation (links to reference materials like
mockups are a great addition for the notes column!). It might be helpful for
multiple people to review the requirements list here and even to have the client
review it if they are comfortable with this level of detail.

Once the requirements have been recorded, grab two developers who are _likely to
work on the project_ and have them individually estimate the requirements. When
they're done, review the estimates, if the difference between the two estimates
is large, schedule a follow up meeting for the developers to discuss. If there
are any items marked as uncertain or worse, see if you can get clarifying
information from the client that would help make all of the estimates certain.

Once the sheet is done, notify the person handling the sale and schedule any
followups as needed.
