# End of Week Wrapup

The end of week wrap up is a quick round-robin of the entire team. The objective is two-fold:

1. A quick mental health check-in to make sure everyone is feeling good, had a decent week, isn't burning out, etc
2. Identifying any missed objectives for the week that project leaders _should definitely_ be aware of for next week
