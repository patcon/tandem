# Ultimate Goals

We want a sales process that...

1. ...is predictable and repeatable. $X invested = Y number new clients = $Z revenue. A moderately talented salesperson should be able to operate 90% of the process with instructions and tooling.
2. ...gains us clients that further Tandem's goals of becoming a company that produces scalable products and services. We should be selling more repeatable "service products," semi-defined packages of services (ex: audits, upgrades, migrations, etc.) that can be delivered for a reliable high-margin by our team. These service products should be in areas we believe can be developed into SaaS product businesses.
