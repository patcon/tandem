# Project Lifecycle

Our projects may range in size, complexity, and duration, but this is our current general framework for the lifecycle of a project.

## Potential Client Discovered and Qualified

* The sales process moves into the Account Manager's hands as soon as we've confirmed a possible project fit.

## Creation of Initial Project Brief

* In initial conversations, the Account Manager sketches a preliminary project brief (located in templates/project-brief.md) including...
  * Major stakeholders
  * Initial client goals/pain points
  * Existing technologies and potential technical requirements

## Discovery Proposal contract generated and signed

* At this point, the Account Manager hands over the Initial Project Brief to the Project Manager and reviews the project details with them up to that point.
* The Project Manager will use this to plan and execute the Discovery

## Discovery Phase (generates a technical architecture plan and an estimate)

* Project Kickoff Call
  * Introductions: meet the team!
  * SoW Review: let’s talk about what we're doing
  * Goal Review: hear more from our client about their long-term goals
  * Reporting: briefly touch on how we track our time and communicate project progress
  * Technical Kickoff: allows time for any Q&A about our options.
  * Strategy Questions: discuss the non-technical portion of this process from persona interviewees to what analytical access is required
  * Any Other Business: if time, we can review any related technical questions, the upcoming analysis methodology, review ADA requirements, or other topics as needed
* Initial technical Q&A with all interested stakeholders
* Identification of the client’s pain points:
  * Stakeholder Interviews
  * Back and forth of creative ideas and possible technical solutions
  * Creation of User Personas
  * Internal shakedown of personas (flow diagramming, journey mapping)
  * Interface brainstorming with client (interactive sketching, UI prototyping)
  * Presentation of User Personas to client for feedback and acceptance

## Project Plan/Estimation → Revision of Project Brief (generates a project schedule, developer resource plan, and infrastructure|hosting plan)

* Once the Project Brief has been revised, it is handed back to the Account Manager
* The Account Manager leads crafting of the proposal and the full contract.

## Full Project Contract Signing

*

## Project Kickoff (with all Tandem development team members and Account Manager, Client’s Product Owner, and any other vested client stakeholders)

* Setting Sprint Cadence (weekly/semi-monthly/etc)
* Scheduling daily internal standups, end-of-sprint client demo, and internal sprint retrospective
* Verification of agreed-upon milestones (checkpoints) along with Product Owner
* Creating ZenHub Project, Kanban board, and backlog of epics and issues
* Setting up Client communication (including clients on Slack/Github, being transparent but not overloading the client with unnecessary information)
* Post-meeting follow-up with Product Owner for ZenHub training

## Sprint Planning

* Estimating a sufficient number of issues in the backlog
* Creating and filling up a (typical two-week) sprint (Dev Team + Product Owner)
* Sprint kickoff

## Day-to-Day Development

* Morning Standups
* Afternoon Check-in(s) via Slack
* Issue management (start a ticket, work it till it’s ready, create pull request, await QA, make sure Technical Lead is aware and that the PR does not go stale)

## Internal Sprint Retrospectives

* Happen every two weeks, immediately after a client show-and-tell demo
* Should occur before a new sprint planning session

## Transition into long-term support (begins approx halfway through a project)

* Creating estimate
* Resource allocation in light of all other active projects
* Contract negotiation and execution

## Project Retrospective

* Internal, with all Tandem dev team members who worked on the project
* External, with Client’s Product Owner, and possibly other interested stakeholders
