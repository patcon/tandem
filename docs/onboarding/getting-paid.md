# Getting PAID

## Employee Payroll
We run payroll twice a month (semi-monthly) on the 15th and the last day of the month.

We handle payroll through [Gusto](https://gusto.com). You should have been invited to Gusto upon joining Tandem and inserted your W2 and direct deposit information. Pay stubs and other payroll information can also be accessed there.

## Contractor Payment

Contractor payment is also handled through Gusto. You should have inserted your W9 and direct deposit information there.

Although we request standard net 30 terms with all our contractors, we typically pay invoices upon shortly after receipt. Project managers review all contractor invoices before payment and may contact with you any questions.

## Zenefits

[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/) is where you can...

- view your employment documents.
- view vacation policy and holidays.
- request time-off.
