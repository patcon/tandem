Benefits
========

Insurance
---------

Currently we don’t offer a group health plan due to issues getting GREAT access for all our team members across multiple states.

In lieu of that, we offer a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) via a program called [PeopleKeep](https://www.peoplekeep.com/) provided by Zanebenefits. This QSEHRA provides tax-exempt money that you can use to purchase qualifying health plans for you and your family.

You should receive an invitation [our PeopleKeep instance](https://tandem.peoplekeep.com/login) before your startdate. Complete the PeopleKeep onboarding prior to your start date and carefully read all documentation provided by PeopleKeep. Don’t hesitate to contact them; we pay for their service so their help staff will be there for you.

Conferences
-----------

As a primarily remote company, Tandem puts a focus on getting the team together for conferences and co-working several times a year.

In the future we'll be developing a more formal plan around conferences, education stipends, and other benefits. However, know that you can expect multiple opportunities to attend (and hopefully speak at) conferences throughout the year with Tandem's sponsorship.
