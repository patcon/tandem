Quarterly Review
================

Each quarter, every Tandem team member should meet with their director. The goals of this meeting are twofold:

* Review team member performance over the last quarter.
* Provide time to reflect on the team member's evolving relationship with Tandem.

To accomplish this, we've combined aspects of a 360 review with a series of more quantitative metrics to provide a gross overview of performance. In this way we get both peer-initiated feedback, as well as a top-down perspective from managers. Finally, we want to hear about the team member's experiences over the quarter. While this shouldn't replace regular one-on-one meetings, it should be a more formal and systematic review.
