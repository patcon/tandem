Slack
======

Tandem uses Slack for real-time internal and client communications. Slack is our
water cooler as well as an area to communicate about work related issues. Here
is a non-exhaustive list of rooms:

Internal
--------

* **General**: For normal company wide communications. When you step foot in
  here, wear your tie, company badge, and ensure you've filed your TPS reports.
* **Random**: Random is the general 'water cooler'. Share gifs, your dog/cat, your
  food, random stuff that doesn't go elsewhere.
* **Vim**: Are you a 1337 coder who can use a few keystrokes on your keyboard to
  write the entire internet (better than Al Gore's version of course)? You'll
  want to share your mastery and skills in the vim channel. I mean, if you emacs
  or something, I guess you can hang too. If you don't know vim well and want to
  learn it, this is a great place to absorb some of the magic.
* **Iamstuck**: Even future millionaires often phone a friend as their critical
  lifeline. You should feel free to do the same. If you are tackling a problem
  that has you stumped, don't wallow in sadness and frustration. Ping the team
  here, there is a good chance one of your colleagues has been down this alley
  before.
* **lando**: Lando is the best local dev environment in the galaxy, but the blue
  caped hero requires lots of planning and brainstorming. Within the Lando
  channel we discuss plans for the project.
* **laravel**: Discuss Laravel related things
* **socialmedia**: We get talked about on the interwebs and the bots tell us
  about it. Keep engaged in those conversations by checking in on this channel
  to see what's up. Jump into the foray on the socials!
* **tandesign**: Talk about design!
* **errorz**: The robots tell us about errors people are running into with some
  of our products, this gives us a bit of a warning so we can investigate.

Mixed Company
-------------

While we use Slack mostly for internal channels, we also invite some outside
folks in to some channels. Channels for specific projects may include the client
as a collaborator. While you should be on your best behavior anyway, just check
yourself before you wreck yourself in the presence of clients.
