Google Meet
========

Tandem utilizes [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) for our video conferencing. 
Since we use GSuite, this makes for convenient [scheduling of video calls for all meetings](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4362302?hl=en), which is essential for a 100% remote company.

Some general recommendations for using Google Meet:

1. All meetings scheduled on the calendar should have a connected Google Meet
   meeting.
2. When listening to a team member speak, mute your microphone to reduce
   feedback, echo, and distractions
3. While not always required, it is nice to have your camera turned on during
   most meetings. We all benefit from seeing each other regularly.
4. Share your screen with the team if you need to show us something
5. If you are bringing in an outside person to a meeting, try to introduce
   everyone for the benefit of our guest and the team.
