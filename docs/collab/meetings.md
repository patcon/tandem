Meetings
========

Tandem's general philosophy and policy around meetings closely [mirrors that of Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/meetings-are-toxic-7e93be7c3043). This ethos can be summed up in the opening paragraph of their blog post titled [Meetings are Toxic](https://m.signalvnoise.com/meetings-are-toxic-7e93be7c3043):

  > Meetings are one of the worst kinds of workplace interruptions. Theyâ€™re held too frequently, run too long, and involve more people than necessary.

  At Tandem, we keep meetings to a minimum, encourage brevity, and strongly prefer concise agendas.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of principles we follow about meetings:

* Meetings are limited as much as possible
* Meetings are usually a waste of time
* Meetings should be short and targeted
* Meetings should be ad-hoc (scheduled as needed, not standing)
* Meetings should have an agenda
* Schedule meetings with flow in mind (batch them, don't sprinkle throughout day)
* Meetings should have defined goals/outcomes (see agenda above)
* only invite people who need to be there
