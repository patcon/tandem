Process Workflow
================

Tandem's standard project workflow is heavily based upon [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). A "Day in the Life" of a developer looks something like this:

Backlog Grooming and Sprint Planning
------------------------------------

Every week project managers review their backlog and put together a sprint, assigning tasks to the appropriate developers. This should mean you have a healthy "stack" of issues every week.

Daily Standup
-------------

At 8AM PST (11AM EST) we do a company-wide standup, which lasts a maximum of 15 minutes. At this meeting, every developer...

* Gives a quick update on the work they've done since yesterday
* Reports on any blocking tasks
* Schedules in-depth conversations needed to unblock or go over newly assigned tasks.

Working on an Issue
-------------------

First things first: make sure you start the Harvest Time Tracker for the issue:

Take a look at the issue. If you have any unresolved questions, reach out to your
project manager.

Horoscope uses [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to organize tasks in a nice Kanban style board. Tasks should fit into one of the following colums:

* **NEW ISSUES:** Task just showed up on the scence (OTS).
* **FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:** Meta task or future food for thought.
* **WITHIN THE QUARTER:** Tasks that should be completed within the quarter.
* **WITHIN THE MONTH:** Tasks that should be completed within the month.
* **IN PROGRESS:** Tasks that are currently being worked on.
* **IN REVIEW:** Tasks that are candidates for closure.
* **CLOSED:** Tasks that are complete.

Here are some general guidelines for dealing with tasks:

* Tasks should all receive story point estimates via the ZenHub `Estimate` field.
* Tasks do not currently track against milestones.
* Tasks can be organized into epics as needed.
* Tasks move from NEW ISSUES to CLOSED.
* Tasks can be created by any member of the Tandem organization and at any time.
* Tasks will be managed and assigned as a team during regularly scheduled standups.
