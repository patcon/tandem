Drupal WCAG Solutions
=====================

1.2: Video, Audio, and other "Time-Based Media"
-----------------------------------------------


### Requirements

In general: your system should be able to provide...

- 1.2.1: Written transcripts and descriptions (A)
- 1.2.2: Written captions (A)
- 1.2.3: "Audio Descriptions" of video content (A)
- 1.2.4: Live Captions (AA)
- 1.2.5: "Audio Descriptions" w/additional contextual info (AA)
-

### Solutions

We find that most of the requirements are addressable by a combination of:

- core Media module
- File Entity module
- YouTube embedded videos
- Audiofield module
- 3rd party services like CaptionSync for live captioning.

**Ex: Accessible Video Implementation**

1. Create a new File Entity type "Accessible Video"
2. Add the main Video field, a text field for a complete transcript (1.2.1/3), and another text field for a summary description (1.2.1).
3. Link to a YouTube video, which will automatically be captioned (1.2.2). Since these captions are generated by machine, they should be [reviewed and customized.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en)


AAA requirements include...

- Sign language
- 1.2.7: Extended audio descriptions of videos. An extended audio description will pause video playback when necessary to relate what's happening in the video to users that have impaired vision. Note that a transcript combined with a regular audio description satisfies this requirement.
