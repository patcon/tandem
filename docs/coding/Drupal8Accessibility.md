Drupal 8 WCAG Solutions
=======================

[WCAG Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)

1.1 Text Alternatives
---------------------

### Requirements

1.1.1 Provide text alternatives for any non‚Äêtext content.

### Solutions

- core Media module

Alt tag is now required for all media in Drupal 8.


1.2: Video, Audio, and other "Time-Based Media"
-----------------------------------------------


### Requirements

In general: your system should be able to provide...

- 1.2.1: Written transcripts and descriptions (A)
- 1.2.2: Written captions (A)
- 1.2.3: "Audio Descriptions" of video content (A)
- 1.2.4: Live Captions (AA)
- 1.2.5: "Audio Descriptions" w/additional contextual info (AA)

### Solutions

We find that most of the requirements are addressable by a combination of:

- core Media module
- File Entity module
- YouTube embedded videos
- Audiofield module
- 3rd party services like CaptionSync for live captioning.

**Ex: Accessible Video Implementation**

1. Create a new File Entity type "Accessible Video"
2. Add the main Video field, a text field for a complete transcript (1.2.1/3), and another text field for a summary description (1.2.1).
3. Link to a YouTube video, which will automatically be captioned (1.2.2). Since these captions are generated by machine, they should be [reviewed and customized.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en)


AAA requirements include...

- 1.2.6: Sign language
- 1.2.7: Extended audio descriptions of videos. An extended audio description will pause video playback when necessary to relate what's happening in the video to users that have impaired vision. Note that a transcript combined with a regular audio description satisfies this requirement.  You could also provide multiple videos to emaulate breaks in videos when there is no talking.
- 1.2.8: For videos that show how to use a product, technology, etc there should be an alternative transcript that describes what they are doing and saying.
- 1.2.9: Similar to 1.2.4 but is intended for captioning of all live broadcasting Time-Based Media types.
