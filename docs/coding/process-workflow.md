Process Workflow
========

Tandem's standard project workflow is heavily based upon [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). A "Day in the Life" of a developer looks something like this:

## Backlog Grooming and Sprint Planning

Every week project managers review their backlog and put together a sprint, assigning tasks to the appropriate developers. This should mean you have a healthy "stack" of issues every week.

## Daily Standup

At 8AM PST (11AM EST) we do a company-wide standup, which lasts a maximum of 15 minutes. At this meeting, every developer...

* gives a quick update on the work they've done since yesterday
* reports on any blocking tasks
* schedules in-depth conversations needed to unblock or go over newly assigned tasks.

## Working on an Issue

First things first: make sure you start the Harvest Time Tracker for the issue:

Take a look at the issue. If you have any unresolved questions, reach out to your
project manager.
