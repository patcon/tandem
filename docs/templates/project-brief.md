Example Project Brief: Cloud City Inc. Informational Portal
===========================================================

**Client:** Cloud City Inc.
**Client Contact:** Lando Calrissian + Lobot Jones
**Project Lead:** Alec Reynolds
**Technical Lead:** Mike Pirog

Background + Overview
---------------------

A short history of the client and their project. If we've worked with them before, we'll want to talk about the cast of characters and events that have gotten us to this project and how it interrelates with other elements of their organization.

Ex: Cloud City Inc. (CCI) is a residential community and Tibanna gas production hub orbiting the gas giant Bespin. Tandem was originally hired by CCI's Chief Administrator, Lando Calrissian, to create a new web portal for Tibanna gas distributors to register with CCI's sales team. Now, Lando has approached us to create a general informational portal for residents of Cloud City so they can access information on all of CCI's offered ammenities.

Project Objectives

1. Inform current residents of CCI's current events, news, and emergency services.
2. Allow current residents to fill out necessary forms online.
3. Attract new residents to Cloud City.
4. Provide a benign front to Imperial Auditors

Roles
-----

**CCI Management**

Lando Calrissian: CCI Chief Administrator and the final force approving contracts. While he has ceded project ownership to Lobot

**Project Owner**

Client-designated manager who is responsible for prioritizing issues, providing feedback on feature design, and being the ultimate representative of stakeholder’s needs for the project. The Project Owner works closely with the Project Manager and has many designated representatives who help him review and approve features.

Lobot Jones: Lobot has been an effective project owner and is able to take ownership over most project decisions. Occasionally he will get vetoed by Lando, particularly on design decisions, so it is often useful to remind him to check with Lando on big stylistic elements. Great at organizing other CCI stakeholders to get buy-in.

**Developer**

External and internal developers alike. Responsibilities center around performing tasks as assigned in Zenhub (project management software), testing functionality, and preparing it for review by the Project Manager and Project Owner.

* Translating project requirements into actionable Zenhub tasks

* Reviewing features created by the Developer
