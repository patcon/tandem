# Handbook

The Handbook is geared towards _the people_ who work with Tandem. It's purpose is to clarify the relationship between Tandem and a person and to get that person up, running and productive as fast as possible while minimizing distraction to others.

Before you step through all the sections in this handbook we _highly recommend_ (eg just do it) you start by:

* [Reading our entire manifesto](./../manifesto/)
* [Skimming guides relevant to your role](./../guides/)
* [Reading our company improvement process](./../guides/improve-tandem.md)
* [Going through our website](https://thinktandem.io/)
* [Reading about Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/)

Once that is done, step through each section in this handbook starting with the [Onboarding Checklist](./onboarding.md)
