Hey [FNAME],

Realized it's been a little bit since we last chatted and was curious how things are going. I know last we spoke you were starting a new gig [LAST KNOWN POSITION INFO], still doing that or onto bigger and better things?

Hope all is well!

Hey [FNAME],

[ESTABLISH RELEVANCY/SHOW VALUE] It's been a while since I [DID SOMETHING WITH YOU], but [STILL THINK ABOUT YOUR HELP/OTHER RELATABLE THING].

After [THAT THING WE DID] I've been running a software development consultancy for the last 5 years. Among other things, we've helped businesses...

- Improve CRM integrations
- Escape vendor lock
- Get rid of expensive legacy systems
- Train or hire in-house development teams

I was wondering if you know anyone at [YOUR ORG] who might be facing these or any other technical problems?

Definitely drop me a line at least to catch up, curious to hear how things are going!

Best,

Alec
