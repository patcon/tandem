RFP Response Process
====================

Find + Review RFPs
------------------

After we've sourced RFPs that appear to fit Tandem's skillset, we should list each opportunity and link to relevant documentation.

Does Tandem Qualify for the RFP?
--------------------------------

The most basic check: are we acceptable candidates for the RFP?! In addition to our normal qualification elements, we should also look at...

- **Timeline:** Do we have at least a week to generate a response?
- **Location Requirements:** Do we need to be located in a given country/state/etc?

RFP Response Outline
--------------------

It's rare that an RFP is short and cogent enough to clearly guide a proposal writer. Once we've decided that the project is a good fit for Tandem, we need to distill the requirements of the RFP into a brief document that will outline our response.

Google Drive provides a good place to copy-and-paste notes and summarize requirements. Here's [an example doc]() that illustrates a good format for collecting these notes.
