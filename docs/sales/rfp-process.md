RFP Response Process
====================

Find RFPs
---------

Every Monday our RFP Guru (John Ouellet) finds a bunch of potential RFPs that appear to fit Tandem's skillset.

Review RFPs
-----------

John then goes through all the RFPs and uses the [RFP Response Outline]() template to extract relevant details about the RFP like deadline, requirements, response format, etc.

Does Tandem Qualify for the RFP?
--------------------------------

The most basic check: are we acceptable candidates for the RFP?! In addition to our normal qualification elements, we should also look at...

- **Timeline:** Do we have at least a week to generate a response?
- **Location Requirements:** Do we need to be located in a given country/state/etc?
- **Certifications:** Anything obscure/unavailable to us?
- **Resume Demands:** Do we need 20 years of Drupal experience or something else impossible?
- **Response Format:** Can we complete the RFP in under 8 hours?
- **Digital Response:** Unless the project is a GREAT fit, we should only respond when we're allowed to email a digital response.

Meeting to Review + Approve RFPs
--------------------------------

Alec and John look at the RFP notes and determine whether they're worth pursuing.

If they are, we create a Github card for each opportunity with...

- deadline
- a link to the RFP notes document that we've started filling out

RFP Response Outline
--------------------

It's rare that an RFP is short and cogent enough to clearly guide a proposal writer. Once we've decided that the project is a good fit for Tandem, we need to distill the requirements of the RFP into a brief document that will outline our response.

Google Drive provides a good place to copy-and-paste notes and summarize requirements. Here's [an example doc]() that illustrates a good format for collecting these notes.

Create the Proposal in PandaDoc
-------------------------------

RFP outline in hand, we can translate

Final Proposal Review
---------------------

Alec and John review the proposal, with special attention to...

- the estimate.
- response format.

Send the Proposal
