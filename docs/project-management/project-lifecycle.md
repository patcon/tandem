Tandem's Expected Project Lifecycle
-----------------------------------

Our projects may range in size, complexity, and duration, but we try to follow these lifecycle stage best practices.

**A)** Potential Client Discovered and Qualified

* The sales process moves into the Account Manager's hands as soon as we've confirmed a possible project fit.

**B)** Creation of Initial Project Brief

* In initial conversations, the Account Manager sketches a preliminary [project brief](templates/project-brief.md) including...
  * Major stakeholders
  * Initial client goals/pain points
  * Existing technologies and potential technical requirements

**C)** Discovery Proposal contract generated and signed

* At this point, the Account Manager hands over the Initial Project Brief to the Project Manager and reviews the project details with them up to that point.
* The Project Manager will use this to plan and execute the Discovery

**D)** Discovery Phase (generates a technical architecture plan and an estimate)

* Initial technical Q&A with all interested stakeholders
* Identification of client’s pain points:
  * Stakeholder Interviews
  * Back and forth of creative ideas and possible technical solutions
  * Creation of User Personas
  * Internal shakedown of personas (flow diagramming, journey mapping)
  * Interface brainstorming with client (interactive sketching, UI prototyping)
  * Presentation of User Personas to client for feedback and acceptance

**E)** Project Plan/Estimation → Revision of Project Brief  (generates a project schedule, developer resource plan, and infrastructure|hosting plan)

* Once the Project Brief has been revised, it is handed back to the Account Manager
* The Account Manager leads crafting of the proposal and the full contract.

**F)** Full Project Contract Signing

**G)** Project Kickoff (with all Tandem development team members and Account Manager, Client’s Product Owner, and any other vested client stakeholders)

* Setting Sprint Cadence (weekly/semi-monthly/etc)
* Scheduling daily internal standups, end-of-sprint client demo, and internal sprint retrospective
* Verification of agreed-upon milestones (checkpoints) along with Product Owner
* Creating ZenHub Project, Kanban board, and backlog of epics and issues
* Setting up Client communication (including clients on Slack/Github, being transparent but not overloading the client with unnecessary information)
* Post-meeting follow-up with Product Owner for ZenHub training

**H)** Sprint Planning

* Estimating a sufficient number of issues in the backlog
* Creating and filling up a (typical two-week) sprint (Dev Team + Product Owner)
* Sprint kickoff

**I)** Day-to-Day Development

* Morning Standups
* Afternoon Check-in(s) via Slack
* Issue management (start a ticket, work it till it’s ready, create pull request, await QA, make sure Technical Lead is aware and that the PR does not go stale)

**J)** Internal Sprint Retrospectives

* Happen every two weeks, immediately after a client show-and-tell demo
* Should occur before a new sprint planning session

**K)** Transition into long-term support (begins approx halfway through a project)

* Creating estimate
* Resource allocation in light of all other active projects
* Contract negotiation and execution

**L)** Project Retrospective

* Internal, with all Tandem dev team members who worked on the project
* External, with Client’s Product Owner, and possibly other interested stakeholders
