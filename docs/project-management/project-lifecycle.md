Tandem's Expected Project Lifecycle
-----------------------------------

Our projects may range in size, complexity, and duration, but we try to follow these lifecycle stage best practices.

**A)** New Lead Discovered

**B)** Creation of Initial Project Brief

**C)** Discovery Proposal contract generated and signed

**D)** Discovery Phase (generates a technical architecture plan and an estimate)
  * Initial technical Q&A with all interested stakeholders
  * Identification of client’s pain points:
    * Stakeholder Interviews
    * Back and forth of creative ideas and possible technical solutions
    * Creation of User Personas
    * Internal shakedown of personas (flow diagramming, journey mapping)
    * Interface brainstorming with client (interactive sketching, UI prototyping)
    * Presentation of User Personas to client for feedback and acceptance

**E)** Project Plan/Estimation → Revision of Project Brief  (generates a project schedule, developer resource plan, and infrastructure|hosting plan)

**F)** Full Project Contract Signing

**G)** Project Kickoff (with all Tandem development team members and Account Manager, Client’s Product Owner, and any other vested client stakeholders)
  * Setting Sprint Cadence (weekly/semi-monthly/etc)
  * Scheduling daily internal standups, end-of-sprint client demo, and internal sprint retrospective
  * Verification of agreed-upon milestones (checkpoints) along with Product Owner
  * Creating ZenHub Project, Kanban board, and backlog of epics and issues
  * Setting up Client communication (including clients on Slack/Github, being transparent but not overloading the client with unnecessary information)
  * Post-meeting follow-up with Product Owner for ZenHub training

**H)** Sprint Planning
  * Estimating a sufficient number of issues in the backlog
  * Creating and filling up a (typical two-week) sprint (Dev Team + Product Owner)
  * Sprint kickoff

**I)** Day-to-Day Development
  * Morning Standups
  * Afternoon Check-in(s) via Slack
  * Issue management (start a ticket, work it till it’s ready, create pull request, await QA, make sure Technical Lead is aware and that the PR does not go stale)

**J)** Internal Sprint Retrospectives
  * Happen every two weeks, immediately after a client show-and-tell demo
  * Should occur before a new sprint planning session

**K)** Transition into long-term support (begins approx halfway through a project)
  * Creating estimate
  * Resource allocation in light of all other active projects
  * Contract negotiation and execution

**L)** Project Retrospective
  * Internal, with all Tandem dev team members who worked on the project
  * External, with Client’s Product Owner, and possibly other interested stakeholders
