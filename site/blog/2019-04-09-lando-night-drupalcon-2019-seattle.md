Our team is having a great time in Seattle for DrupalCon, and if you're here, we want you to share in the fun!

We're holding an informal gathering for Lando users, the Lando curious, and everyone in between. Come celebrate the end of DrupalCon on Thursday, April 11th with good conversation and good beer. No registration is necessary; we do have drink tickets, but supply is limited, so remember to stop by early.

**Lando Beers** <br/>
Thursday, April 11th 5:30PM - 8:30PM <br/>
[Optimism Brewing](http://optimismbrewing.com) <br/>

If you can't make it out, ping @thinktandem or @devwithlando on Twitter and we'll try to get together some other evening at the conference. Looking forward to seeing you!
