A few months ago we realized something: our website didn't reflect the work we were doing at Tandem.

When we started Tandem, our mission was to improve the lives of web developers. That's why we built tools like [Kalabox](https://www.kalabox.io), did a bunch of DevOps trainings, and helped our clients implement continuous integration workflows.

However, we were doing so much more than that. On some projects we were the catalyst for adopting lean and user-centric web application design. In others, we were completely re-architecting legacy systems and implementing modern replacements to save our clients time and money.

Clearly we were not longer the DevOps-focused consultancy our website said we were.

## New Site, New Mission

We're happy to announce the launch of our new website. It showcases our longstanding experience with web application development, testament to our team filled with Drupal, Backdrop, Laravel, WordPress, and NodeJS masters. It highlights our no-nonsense approach to user research, discovery, and web application design. And yes, we're still implementing continuous integration workflows, solving DevOps problems, and making other awesome time-saving things for developers like our successor project to Kalabox, [Lando](https://docs.lndo.io).

> If our old mission was to improve the lives of developers, our new mission is to empower ALL stakeholders in software projects.

No matter how complex or confusing your problems may seem, Tandem can create simple, efficient solutions to them. We have the tools, the team, and a finely tuned process.

So sit back, relax, and hop on a Hangout or phone call with us. We've got your back!
