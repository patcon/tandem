Picking a digital partner is hard. What firm can understand your strategy, translate that into conversion-increasing design, and then develop a website on your chosen technology platform? After reading multiple proposals and sifting through digital agency websites you can feel trapped in a web of buzzwords, less sure than when you started.

Tandem is here to help you eliminate that confusion. We arm you with the best information available to make decisions that help you grow your organization through digital marketing and web application development. Since that process starts with selecting a digital partner, we want to provide you with no-nonsense ways of understanding how we work. That's why we publish [our documentation](https://docs.thinktandem.io) and as much of [our code](https://github.com/thinktandem) as possible.

To help you get an even better picture of what Tandem is all about, we've been encouraging our clients to review us on [Clutch](https://clutch.co/profile/think-tandem). Clutch is a B2B ratings and reviews website that interviews previous clients about past projects over the phone or with an in-depth online questionnaire. The resulting reviews are one of the biggest factors in Clutch’s rankings for the companies on their site. Market presence, awards, and work experience also influence the ranking methodology.

The upshot? You can actually see what people have said about us! Although only a few of our clients have had the time to provide a review, the feedback has already made us one of the top Drupal development firms. Here are a couple of quotes that our clients have said about us:

“They executed a smooth and timely project. The dedicated team was extremely responsive and open to feedback.” – Web Services Director, University

“I've worked with a lot of developers over the years, and Tandem is incredibly easy to communicate with. Alec made the process very pleasant, and the whole team was an absolute pleasure to work with.” – Head of Product, Market Research and Consulting Firm

Due to our outstanding reputation we've also been ranked one of the top Drupal Developers in San Francisco on Clutch's sister site, [The Manifest](https://themanifest.com).

We’re excited to see what the rest of 2019 has waiting for all of us. Hopefully our reviews on Clutch give you a better idea of who Tandem is and demonstrate our commitment to transparency, but [let us know](/contact) if there's more we can do to help you find the best partner for your next digital project.
