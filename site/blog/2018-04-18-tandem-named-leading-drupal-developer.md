Last month, the B2B ratings and reviews platform Clutch named the top San Francisco agencies and developers in 2018. We are proud to announce that Tandem was recognized for our expertise and made [the list](https://clutch.co/developers/drupal/san-francisco)!

While we have experience with a variety of technologies, Drupal is our top choice for enterprise-grade needs because of its strength as an open source content management system. We've been working with Drupal for over 6 years, and many of our developers have been Drupal contributors for more than a decade. This is why we are thrilled to be featured in this research as one of the top 15 Drupal developers.

To determine the leaders for this report, Clutch evaluated hundreds of companies on their ability to deliver their services, past work, market presence, and most important, their client reference reviews.

With every project, we deliver finely honed code and impressive digital strategies with our client’s needs and best interests in mind. Our team does everything we can to increase the value each business gets from its technology-enabled channels. As a result of our dedication and top-notch services, we’ve experienced successes and earned an overall 5-star rating from our client on Clutch. Check out the great comments they shared about their experience working with us and the database architecture we developed for them:

> I've worked with a lot of developers over the years, and Tandem is incredibly easy to communicate with...The whole team was an absolute pleasure to work with. They understood our business goals and provided quality development.

Thank you to our clients for sharing your feedback, and to Clutch for including us in their research!
