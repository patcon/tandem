::: important Digital strategy is about your users.
Your users, and their goals, will inform every other decision made in your digital ecosystem. Together, we’ll get to know them, their habits, their motivators, and their skill level. We’ll combine demographic and psychographic information and compare that to your analytics to determine the optimal user journey. With a focus on continual growth, we’ll customize a discovery or ongoing analysis to keep your team informed as you determine next steps. Educated decisions lead to better, sustainable growth.

::: point Why even strategize?
You don't want to build a car powered by gas before learning that your users actually want solar powered spaceships :rocket:. Not only does this product-market mismatch significantly limit growth potential it also costs way more turning a gas powered car into a solar powered spaceship than just building a solar powered space ship to begin with.
