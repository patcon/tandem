::: point Summary.
Brandywine already had a well built site.  They were looking for an agency to help them with small adjustments and security updates.  We keep their site up to date with all security and regular updates.  We help them with any changes they may need with the site on request.  We also converted their site to use https and got their site on a CDN as well.
:::

> Keeping our site up to date ensures our visitors have a good experience with our site.
