::: point Summary.
Brandywine needed a reliable partner for ongoing development and security updates. Tandem proactively updates Brandywine's Drupal 7 website to ensure security, but also helps with on-demand requests for support.  In the process, we also converted their site to use SSL and improved performance by installing a CDN.
