::: point Summary.
Hospitality Homes had a 10 year old Drupal 6 website that had security and usability issues.  We were able to update core and all modules via the Drupal 6 Long Term Support initiative.  We were also able to update their PHP version to 7.3 on their  Media Temple server.  Finally, we addressed a few small bugs and issues with the site.
