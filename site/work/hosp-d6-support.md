::: point Summary.
Hospitality Homes had a 10-year-old Drupal 6 website with security and usability issues.  We were able to convert the site to use the Drupal 6 Long Term Support (LTS) version, extending the lifespan of the website by years.  We were also able to update their PHP version to 7.3, despite the site being hosted on irregular server.  Finally, we addressed a few small bugs and issues with the site.
