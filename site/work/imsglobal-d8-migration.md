::: point Summary.
The talented IMS Global development team was well on its way to rebuilding their complicated Drupal 7 site in Drupal 8, but knew that building expertise in Drupal data migrations might extend their project by months. Working hand-in-hand, Tandem was able to take IMS's information architecture plans and complete an intricate Drupal 8 migration. In the process, hundreds of thousands of node objects were split into varying Drupal 8 data structures.

::: important Working in Tandem
We worked side by side with their development team during the entire migration project.  Their development team then used our setup to finish the remaining portions of the Drupal 8 site.
