::: point Summary.
IMS Global had a complicated Drupal 7 site that they planned to migrate to Drupal 8.  The site would be completely rearchitected on the backend and their development needed to bring in an agency with expertise in the area.  We took the information architecture plans from their development and executed one of the most complicated Drupal 8 migrations we have done to date.  Hundreds of thousands of nodes were split into varying data structures in the end.

We worked side by side with their development team during the entire migration project.  Their development team then used our setup to finish the remaining portions of the Drupal 8 site.
