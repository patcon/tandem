::: point Summary.
InterACTâ€™s website was slow and had a few small bugs.  They needed an agency to help them on an as needed basis with their WordPress site.  We moved the hosting of the site from GoDaddy to Pantheon to better manage the site and help with performance.  We fixed a few small bugs on the site and helped keep the core and plugins up to date.
