::: point Summary.
InterACTâ€™s website was slow and had a few small bugs.  They needed an agency to help them with ongoing development of their WordPress site.  We moved the hosting of the site from GoDaddy to [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) to better manage the site and help with performance.  We fixed a few small bugs on the site and helped keep their website updated.
