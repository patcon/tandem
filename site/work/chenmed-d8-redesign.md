::: point Summary.
ChenMed is on a mission to restore the doctor-patient relationship in modern healthcare, but their flagship web property wasn’t doing a good enough job communicating that mission to physicians and patients. We worked with ChenMed to design and develop a robust component-driven site that better incorporated ChenMed’s brand, while allowing the marketing team far more flexibility in building new pages to tell ChenMed's value-based care story.
:::

> Components empower our marketing team to better tell our story the way we want while always maintaining brand consistency.
