::: point Summary.
UCSF's Memory and Aging Center (MAC) is one of the premier sources for information on dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. Serving audiences ranging from academics to patients and their caregivers, the MAC wanted to simplify their site structure to help visitors get easier access to the information they need. Informed by stakeholder interviews and Google Analytics, Tandem was able to work with the MAC to restructure their sitemap around common areas of concern. We also helped the MAC by developing several key features for this Drupal-powered site, including an improved staff search function, multilingual support, an integration with IBM Brassring to import job postings, and galleries for art created by patients.

The MAC didn't need a new website, and they had strong support from the UCSF web team for day-to-day support needs. They just needed  strategic help to improve their website's information architecture and targeted development of specific features.
