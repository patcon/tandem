::: point Summary.
Maintaining member records within the Blackbaud donor management suite was eating up hundreds staff hours for the Academy of American Poets. Tandem found a way to end the busy work by automating membership updates via the Blackbaud SKY API.
:::

::: important Consolidated User Management.
Tandem built the [Blackbaud SKY API module](https://www.drupal.org/project/blackbaud_sky_api) to provide a universal way for Drupal sites to communicate and sync with a Blackbaud instance. This module has allowed Poets staff and constituents to update their user data in single place, the Poets.org website, knowing data is two-way synced to Blackbaud freeing up tons of time to focus more on growing memberships.
