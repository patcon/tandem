::: point Summary.
The Academy of American Poets had been utilizing various Blackbaud products for well over a decade. The academyâ€™s internal staff had the diligent task of maintaining all records within Blackbaud. This ate up considerable time and they needed to find a better way; insert Tandem.

::: important Consolidated User Management.
Tandem built the [Blackbaud SKY API module](https://www.drupal.org/project/blackbaud_sky_api) to provide a universal way for Drupal sites to communicate and sync with a Blackbaud instance. This module has allowed Poets staff and constituents to update their user data in single place, the poets.org website, knowing data is two-way synced to Blackbaud freeing up tons of time to focus more on growing memberships.
