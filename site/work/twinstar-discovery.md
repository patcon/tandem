::: point Summary.
With revamped design mockups in hand, we were tasked with migrating their existing Drupal 7 site.  We planned the information architecture of the new Drupal 8 site and laid out the migration path.  We were able to use a repeatable migration process to adapt incoming design changes from the C Suite during the build.  In the end, TwinStarâ€™s site got a fresh new look that served their customers better

::: important Strategy.
Tandem worked closely with TwinStar to understand their unique member base. Combining research previously compiled, analytics, competition, and goal setting our strategy team took a dive into who their members are and why they turned to TwinStar. Our technical lead analyzed the technologies used and those available. Through this understanding, we were able to:

- Help identify key performance indicators (KPI) and their current standing
- Propose an updated navigation and landing page mapping
- Perform an analysis of the technologies used and their ease of migration to a newer platform
- Plan out next steps with a focus on the initial phase with timeline and budget
