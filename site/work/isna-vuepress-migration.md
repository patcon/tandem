::: point Summary.
ISNA had a heavily trafficked Drupal 4.6 site that was over 15 years old.  The cost to keep this legacy site was high and they needed a cheaper and more efficient way to keep the site alive.  We were able to archive and migrate the site to VuePress to achieve this goal.  We migrated the existing site data with CSV and used a custom Symfony CLI tool to convert the files to VuePress Markdown.
