::: point Summary.
Kent State's Forever Brighter Microsite was composed mainly of two custom post types, Case Studies and Donors.  The Donor CPT was designed to manually reference Case Studies via copying and pasting the case study title and taxonomy term.  This lead to a cumbersome editorial experience that could produce erroneous results.  To fix this, we streamlined the editorial experience with relationship based Advanced Custom Fields.

By utilizing ACF's Relationship Fields, we were able to link Donor and Case Studies together via the Case Study's Taxonomy Terms.  This allowed for a streamlined editorial experience and alleviated any erroneous entries.
