::: point Summary.
MSTS Tolls was rebuilding their Drupal 7 site on WordPress.  One of the features we were tasked to build was a complicated mapping feature based on a variety of selections.  With the aid of Advanced Custom Fields, WordPress REST API, Gutenberg, and Amcharts on top of our own custom functionality, we were able to deliver the solution as designed.
