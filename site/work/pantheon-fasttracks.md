::: point Summary.
We've been working with Pantheon since they were 8 people in an office under the Bay Bridge. As a result we know their product, platform and team better than most. So, when Pantheon asked us to provide some extra bandwidth for their Fast Track training program, we immediately said *"We've got you!"*
:::

> It was awesome we could turn to Tandem and ramp up our training capacity with almost no onboarding!

::: important DevOps. Workflows. Kalabox. Coffee
Trainings were typically multi-day and on-site, fueled by rich presentation materials, interactive workshops and lots of coffee. We focused on some combination of the following topics:

* Pantheon basics
* Migrations
* Using New Relic with Pantheon
* Kalabox and Lando for Local Development
* Advanced DevOps: Using CircleCI, GitHub flow, Behat and Quicksilver
* Deep Developer Dives: Troubleshooting specific developer questions
* Pantheon Tips and Tricks

At the conclusion of the trainings and as reward for a group job well done we always made sure to reward everyone with a happy hour!
