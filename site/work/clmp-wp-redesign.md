::: point Summary.
The Community of Literary Magazines and Presses had an outdated and poorly functioning WordPress site that no longer easily served their members' needs. Together we went through a thorough discovery phase and overhauled the user experience to focus on simplicity and mobile. The result was a beautiful, responsive, fast and navigable website.
:::

> Our members were increasingly using mobile and now our site reflects that reality.

::: col-half Migration I:
We wrote a custom migration plugin to extract and transform all the old data to our new and performance optimized architecture.

::: col-half Migration II:

50k+ items

::: important UX Overhaul.
After a close discovery process with CLMP we generated wireframes, component designs, and mockups to help steer the new design.
