::: point Summary.
The United Group’s Drupal website was manually setup to import users and their data from the act! CRM.  It was a cumbersome manual task that often ended with issues.  We were able to create an API bridge via act!’s swagger setup.  This allowed us to create a custom module that imported and updated / created users via Drupal’s cron.  This in turn alleviated all of their issues that arose from the manual process.
