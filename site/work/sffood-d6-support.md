::: point Summary.
SF / Marin Foodbank’s Volunteer Calendar websites were getting hacked on a regular basis.  Their websites were on legacy versions of Drupal 6, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  We were able to update their in house server LAMP stack to their most recent versions.  We also updated their Drupal 6 sites to their Long Term Support Versions.  This addressed and alleviated their security issues and their sites are able to function properly.
:::

> Our sites are no longer getting hacked since we updated our whole platform.
