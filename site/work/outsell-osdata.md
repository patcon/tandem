::: point Summary.
Outsell Inc. had accumulated a ton of data on the information and technology sectors over the last twenty years. However, while the value of their insights had grown, their ability to collect and maintain that data was bottlenecked by a legacy data entry application. Tandem modernized their data collection ability using Laravel, allowing them to 10x their entry velocity while drastically reducing their data maintenance costs.
:::

> From requirements and scoping to development and deployment, Tandem coordinated with all stakeholders to deliver the best solution to support our business needs. I highly recommend Tandem to anyone looking for strategic development.
> - Ben Sampson, Head of Product

::: important Right tool. Right job.
Using Laravel's powerful object relational mapping (ORM) layer we were able to quickly adapt to Outsell’s custom data model and create an elegant front-end for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations against their legacy database. Laravel’s extensive ecosystem of libraries made it easy to find the best tools to power search, advanced reporting, and other features.

Outsell is now able to onboard large teams of data entry specialists, drastically increasing their ability to collect and maintain records. This means that Outsell’s customers can now expect even more detailed reports and greater self-service access to company records.
