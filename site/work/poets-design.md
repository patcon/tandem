Poets.org is a elegant resource that connects users to over a million poets, poems, educational resources, event and more. With a large member-base and many more casual visitors, the site needs to be able to reach a huge audience, keeping our focus on user experience, accessibility and on brand representation.

Tandem performed many of the tasks associated with a full discovery to build the knowledge base that would inform the team. This included:

-   Stakeholder Interviews

-   Industry Research

-   Analytics Review

-   Persona Development

From here the creative team worked together with our strategists to review brand documentation and identify the strengths of the current website. We developed an array of creative assets including:

-   Wireframes for specialized content types

-   Mobile mockups

-   Desktop mockups

-   Invision Prototypes

With active client participation, we embraced all that Poets.org wanted to communicate in a repeatable way that can scale with their ever-growing site. This new design, reminiscent of the old, honors the tradition, creativity and overall brand of Poet.org.

Site launch is expected Spring 2019.
