::: point Summary.
KFP had a Drupal 7 proposal management system that was built haphazardly and they were investing a lot of time and money to try and fix numerous architectural issues.  There were numerous issues with their proposal workflow, permissions, and user experience to name a few.  To fix this we designed and architected a robust system in Drupal 8.  We migrated the complex data into a Group based system, overhauled the user experience, and integrated with services like OneHub and Slack.
:::

> Group based permission workflows allow committee members to quickly and easily vote on proposals.
