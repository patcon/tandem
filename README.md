# Tandem

This repository contains assets to guide the why, what and how of Tandem as an agency-incubator. It may be useful to think of it as an "agency-incubator business" start state.

@TODO: improve above to be better, sexier, more feelsy?

Specifically its purpose is to:

### 1. Express our mission and core principles

introduce new employees, potential clients, and any other future collaborators to what makes us tick. remind current employees why and how we do things ;)

### 2. Serve as a single source of truth

manifesto/docs
cross-project assets: templates, automation scripts, etc

### 3. Define a process to self update

a fair, just and objective-as-possible process to improve the business.. and everything else that we do and the mechanisms to make that process as painless and flow-maximizing as possible

## Structure

This repository contains various assets but they can be broken down into four broad categories

### 1. Documentation

Documentation

* Our core founding documents, mission statement, roadmap, history
* Our employee handbook and onboarding docs
* Guides that codify our key processes

#### Manifesto

DNA, goals, roadmap, roles, org

what kinds of things go here?

#### Handbook

employee onboarding materials

this is your best chance to improve the docs

#### Guides

these should answer questions like "how do i do X at tandem?"

what about project specific stuff? should that go in our project scaffolding?
  example: how do i submit code? is it more likely for a developer to see that

where does sales go?

### 2. Templates

  SHOULD THIS live in docs/templates so we can have share it between the docs site
  and something we can pull?

  a. README.md and project documentation scaffolding
    a. readme
    b. getting started checklist: things that need ot be setup before we start
    b. dev docs
    c. project brief
    d. architectureal plan
    e. more?
  b. devops
    a. github issue/pr templates
    b. travis/platform/lando seeds
  c. project management stuff
    a. github labels?
    b.

### 3. Automation scripts

### 4. Lando plugins?

@TODO: anything else? this seems like a good starting point

## How is it used?

1. documentation is surfaced here:
2. assets can be pulled down by our start states/projects should we just package up stuff into a zip for now and have projects pull that in?

## Contributing

what is the process for updating this material? how do we work on advancing the material?

considerations? PR template checklist?
