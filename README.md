This is a repository that contains non-billable tasks for Tandem. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some task titles that might live here:

  1. Spin up a spreadsheet to track productivity
  2. Launch internal documentation site for Tandem
  3. Document roles and responsibilites
  4. Q2 sales initiatives
  5. Solctice party planning
  6. Hiring laravel developer
  7. Google hangout whiskey tasting?

There is a GitHub issue template that you can follow but at the very least stub out a title.

Task Workflow
-------------

Horoscope uses [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to organize tasks in a nice Kanban style board. Tasks should fit into one of the following colums:

  * **NEW ISSUES:** Task just showed up on the scence (OTS).
  * **FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:** Meta task or future food for thought.
  * **WITHIN THE QUARTER:** Tasks that should be completed within the quarter.
  * **WITHIN THE MONTH:** Tasks that should be completed within the month.
  * **IN PROGRESS:** Tasks that are currently being worked on.
  * **IN REVIEW:** Tasks that are candidates for closure.
  * **CLOSED:** Tasks that are complete.

Here are some general guidelines for dealing with tasks:

  * Tasks should all receive story point estimates via the ZenHub `Estimate` field.
  * Tasks do not currently track against milestones.
  * Tasks can be organized into epics as needed.
  * Tasks move from NEW ISSUES to CLOSED.
  * Tasks can be created by any member of the Tandem organization and at any time.
  * Tasks will be managed and assigned as a team during regularly scheduled standups.
