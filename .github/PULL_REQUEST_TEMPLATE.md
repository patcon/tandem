I just submitted code and now I want to make sure it's ready for primetime!!!

In order to do that I need to first go through the below checklist entitled "For Me" because I respect my coworkers and want to get this PR into the best place possible before i ask for their time. When i am done i will then summon reviewers for feedback and comment. These reviewers will have about a week to complete their review.

If they do not review in the time alloted or have no change requests or blocking concerns _**the person who opened the pull request**_ will apply the "Ready to merge" label which will ping the Keepers of Faith to press the merge button.
