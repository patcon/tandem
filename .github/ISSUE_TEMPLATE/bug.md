Make sure you have read about the [different kinds of tickets](https://tandem-docs.lndo.site/guides/improve-tandem.html#suggesting-a-change) and then complete the following questions

1. Describe the issue in a few sentences. Try to be as succinct and high level as possible. The goal is to be able to quickly communicate, you could think about it as just writing a slightly more detailed version of the title. You'll be able to be more detailed later.

> Example: I'm trying to run `lando awesome-sauce` but it's throwing a "php not found error".

2. Write out concrete steps someone can take to replicate the bug or problem.

> Example:
> 1. Step 1
> 2. Step 2
> ...
> n. Step n

3. Sketch a proposed solution. If this is an improvement a user story might be a good place to start. This does not have to be a techincal suggestion although it certainly can be if that makes sense.

> Example: As a user i expect to be sent immediately to my Dashboad when i log in instead i am sent to a random page and that is confusing.

4. Make sure you complete the following checklist

- [ ] I've added either the `bug` or `improvement` label
- [ ] I've selected the label that _best_ describes what part of the business this ticket improves eg `sales`, `dev`, etc
- [ ] I've added a story point estimation. **This should never exceed 3!!!**
