Make sure you have read about the [different kinds of tickets](https://tandem-docs.lndo.site/guides/improve-tandem.html#suggesting-a-change) and then complete the following questions:

1. Describe the task that needs to be completed sentences. This could be a user story, a checklist of action items, a rough technical spec, a combination of those or something else entirely. A good rule of thumb is to include the "minimal amount of information required" so that someone else can _get started_ advancing the task without requiring a ton of feedback

> Example:
> We need to set up Google Analytics on the documentation site. Here is a link to the relevant `vuepress` [docs](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/config/#ga). Our GA user/pass is in Lastpass.

2. Make sure you complete the following checklist

- [ ] I've selected the label that _best_ describes what part of the business this ticket improves eg `sales`, `dev`, etc
- [ ] I've added a story point estimation. **This should never exceed 3!!!**
