## Prompt

> Example: A lack of standard and well-defined GitHub issues we can share across projects is causing unneeded confusion and overhead. Should we have some standard labels? What should they be?
>
> [Here are some good guideliness for writing out discussions](https://docs.thinktandem.io/guides/improve-tandem.html#_1-discussion)

## Ticket Checklist

Make sure you complete the following checklist

- [ ] I'm aware of [what a discussion actually entails](https://docs.thinktandem.io/guides/improve-tandem.html#suggesting-a-change)
- [ ] I've selected _at most_ two labels that _best_ describe what part of the business this ticket improves eg `sales`, `dev`, etc

## Ping some folks!

Discussions only work when people _actually discuss_. To aid that process it's worth pinging the people who you think might be most interested in contributing to the discussion. Do that here!

> Example: Hey @person1, @person2, ... and @personN! Tell me what you think!

## Follow up tasks

If this discussion spawns additional tickets it might be worth dropping them here once they are ready to go.

> Example:
> - [ ] #12
> - [ ] #48
