Make sure you have read about the [different kinds of tickets](https://tandem-docs.lndo.site/guides/improve-tandem.html#suggesting-a-change) and then complete the following questions

1. Now [what shall we talk about?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyZ5GVUSQuU) This is probably best expressed as a simple proposition and then a question. Try to make both as narrowly scoped and simple as possible. Remember that ideally the discussion can be resolved async in this issue and done in less than 3 story points.

> Example: I'm wondering whether we should change the maximum upperbound on story points for discussions from 3 to 5. But i'm worried that would hurt our througput and slow our intertia. What do you guys think?

2. Make sure you complete the following checklist

- [ ] I've selected the label that _best_ describes what part of the business this ticket improves eg `sales`, `dev`, etc
- [ ] I've added a story point estimation. **This should never exceed 3!!!**
